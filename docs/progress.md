# Progress

Snapshot of what's done and what's next, so a new session (human or Claude
Code) can continue without re-deriving decisions already made. Update this
when a milestone's status changes — don't let it go stale.

## Done

**Milestone 1 — Foundation & Contracts.** Git repo initialized
(`main`/`dev`, GitHub remote `Demidoga/scd_a1`). Domain contract
(`Category`/`Priority`/`Status` enums, explicit transition table,
`TriageResult`) in `backend/app/domain/`. `TriageProvider` protocol +
3-implementation scope (no Ollama, `docs/architecture/ai.md` §0) in
`backend/app/providers/triage/`. Frontend runtime config decision (nginx
`/api` proxy) recorded in ADR 0002, not yet implemented (frontend doesn't
exist yet). Compose/Kubernetes topology decisions recorded in the
architecture docs, not yet implemented. `backend/pyproject.toml` (ruff,
mypy, pytest+coverage) configured and passing. ADRs 0001–0004 written.

**Milestone 2 — Database & Backend Core.** PostgreSQL schema via one Alembic
migration (`backend/alembic/versions/0001_create_complaints.py`), verified
against the ORM model with `alembic check` (zero drift). Repository layer
(`ComplaintRepository`), service layer (`ComplaintService`), all 9 API
endpoints (`backend/app/routes/`), `/health` + `/ready`, structured JSON
logging with request-ID propagation (`app/core/logging.py`,
`app/core/middleware.py`), graceful shutdown via FastAPI lifespan, idempotent
seed (`backend/app/seed.py` + `seed_data.py`, 36 complaints across all 6
categories, Urdu-influenced English).

**Milestone 3 — AI Triage & Redis.** `LLMTriage` (Groq), `RuleBasedTriage`,
`SimulatedTriage` all implemented and provider-factory-selectable via
`TRIAGE_PROVIDER`. Retry-once-then-fallback orchestration in
`TriageService`. Redis triage content-hash cache (24h TTL, stores
provenance), stats cache (30s TTL, `X-Cache` header, invalidated on write),
distributed rate limiter (atomic Lua INCR+EXPIRE, fixed-window, fails
closed on Redis outage; caches fail open). Prompt-injection guardrail in the
`LLMTriage` prompt.

**Milestone 4 — Complete Backend API & Tests.** All endpoints finished
including `/api/stats`, `/api/meta/providers`, `/metrics`. 112 tests (63
unit, 49 integration — see `backend/tests/`), 94.5% coverage on `app/`
(gate is 65%). Mandatory fallback test
(`tests/integration/test_fallback_e2e.py`) passes end-to-end through the
real HTTP API via `app.dependency_overrides`.

## Known, deliberate gaps (not oversights)

- **No Ollama.** Instructor-approved scope reduction — see ADR 0001 and
  `docs/architecture/ai.md` §0.
- **Local dev Postgres is v17, not v16.** `apt` only offered 17 in this
  sandbox. Production-shaped artifacts (Milestone 6+) will pin `postgres:16`
  as required. See `docs/ENGINEERING-NOTES.md`.
- **No live Groq smoke test yet.** `LLMTriage` is fully implemented and
  unit-tested against mocked HTTP responses, but hasn't been exercised
  against the real Groq API — no `LLM_API_KEY` has been provided to this
  session yet. Drop a key into `backend/.env` and run
  `TRIAGE_PROVIDER=llm uv run uvicorn app.main:app` to smoke-test it.
- **`triaged_by` allows `simulated`** in addition to the three values
  `docs/architecture/database.md` §1 literally lists — a resolved doc gap
  from before the no-Ollama decision, not a silent deviation. See
  `docs/ENGINEERING-NOTES.md`.
- **Git workflow is local-only so far.** `dev` branch created locally;
  GitHub branch protection / required PR reviews on `main`/`dev` haven't
  been configured through the GitHub UI or `gh` (not installed in this
  sandbox) — that's a manual step outside this session's tool access.

## Next

**Milestone 5 — Frontend.** Not started. Needs: complaint submission page,
operations dashboard (filter/paginate/status-update), stats view, typed API
client generated/checked against the backend's OpenAPI doc
(`http://localhost:8000/openapi.json` once the backend is running), runtime
config per ADR 0002 (nginx `/api` proxy — no absolute backend URL baked into
the Vite build).

After that, in order: Milestone 6 (Docker/Compose — five-container topology,
`edge`/`internal` networks), 7–8 (Kubernetes baseline, then HPA/VPA + load
testing), 9 (CI/CD), 10 (docs/evidence/hardening). See
`docs/architecture/roadmap.md` and `docs/Milestones.md` for the full
dependency chain — don't jump ahead to Kubernetes work while anything in the
backend contract is still moving.
